# Metallic

Metallic is a minimal library for meta-learning research based on [PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch) and [higher](https://github.com/facebookresearch/higher).

Different from other meta-learning libraries (like [learn2learn](https://github.com/learnables/learn2learn) and [Torchmeta](https://github.com/tristandeleu/pytorch-meta)), Metallic aims at providing an lightweight framework with the least amount of code for setting up meta-learning experiments quickly.

This library is **work in progress**.
